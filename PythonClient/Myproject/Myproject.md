The work of https://github.com/asap-report/carla is used as a starting point.This repository has been forked from the same.
The code of the project is at https://github.com/aravind93raja/carla/tree/Myproject/PythonClient/Myproject.

Goals of the Project are 4 fold :

1)To simulate the Track following capabilities of a PID Based Controller. 

( Done )  CODE: PIDControl_DataCollection.py

2)To collect Dataset of Depth Iamges and and Steering values for training on a Neural Network. 

( Done )  CODE: PIDControl_DataCollection.py

3)To Implement and Simulate Error state Extended Kalman Filter 

(In Progress ) Ground Work on my other repository :https://github.com/aravind93raja/State-Estimation-and-Localization

4)To Train a Neural Network based on [Nvidia's End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf "Nvidia's End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars")  with Depth Images instead of RGB Images for prediction of Steering Values.

(In Progress )
